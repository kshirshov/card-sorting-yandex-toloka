        <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
        
        <p>We use Google Analytics to collect and process data about your use of our Services. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics.

        <h2>Browser Extension</h2>
        
        <p>Our browser extension also uses Google Analytics to collect usage data. However, we want to emphasize that the extension does not collect any user information from the notes you create. Your notes are stored locally in your browser's storage and are not transmitted to our servers or any third-party services.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>

<p>The notes you create using our browser extension are stored locally in your browser's storage. For Chrome users, this means your notes are saved in Chrome's local storage and are not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

<p>In addition to local storage, some information may be stored using cookies on your device. This information is typically used for improving your browsing experience and for analytics purposes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as mentioned in the Google Analytics section, some data about your usage of our Services is stored on Google Analytics servers. This data is used for analyzing usage patterns and improving our Services. It's important to note that this data is anonymized and does not include the content of your notes.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        
        <p>You can opt-out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You can also manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings.</p>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
